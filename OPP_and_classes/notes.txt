Class & Object:
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class containing data and methods.



4 key properties of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) -

1. Encapsulation:
   Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access using private/protected members.

2. Inheritance:
   Allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another, promoting code reuse.

3. Polymorphism:
   The ability to use the same method name in different ways (e.g., method overriding in child classes).

4. Abstraction:
   Hides complex internal details and shows only essential features to the user using abstract classes or methods.
