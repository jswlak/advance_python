## What is Kivy?

    Kivy is a Python framework for building cross-platform GUI apps.

    You can write once, and run on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS.

    It uses OpenGL for graphics, so itâ€™s good for modern UIs and touch-based apps.

## Install Kivy:
    pip install "kivy[base]" kivy_examples
